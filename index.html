    <h1>Peertube</h1>
    <p><h4>Who is behind Peertube?</h4></p>
<p><em><strong>PeerTube was started in 2017 and is primarily developed by the French non-profit organization Framasoft. Framasoft is known for its work on "de-googlifying the internet" by offering free and ethical alternatives to tech giant services.</strong></em></p>
 <p><h2>How it works</h2></p>
<p><strong><em>Decentralized instances:</em></strong> Anyone can set up their own PeerTube instance, or server, creating their own video website with unique rules and content.</p>
<p><strong><em>Federation:</em></strong> Instances can connect to each other through the ActivityPub protocol, allowing users on one instance to watch videos hosted on another. This creates a larger, federated network known as the "Fediverse".</p>
<p><strong><em>Peer-to-peer (P2P) streaming:</em></strong> When a video goes viral, PeerTube uses WebRTC technology to enable peer-to-peer streaming. This allows viewers to share video data with each other, which reduces the bandwidth load on the hosting server.</p> 
<p><h2>Key features and benefits</h2></p>
<p><strong><em>No vendor lock-in:</em></strong> Creators can export and move their content between different PeerTube instances.</p>
<p><strong><em>No ads or tracking:</em></strong> PeerTube instances are typically not ad-supported and do not track user data for profiling. Monetization is up to individual instance administrators or creators, who can add support buttons for donations.</p>
<p><strong><em>Community-based moderation:</em></strong> Each instance has its own administration and moderation policies, fostering diverse and independent communities.</p>
<p><strong><em>Live streaming:</em></strong> The platform supports live video broadcasting.</p>
<p><strong><em>Mobile apps:</em></strong> Official PeerTube mobile apps are available for both Android and iOS.</p>
